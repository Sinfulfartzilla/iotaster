This project is putting a toaster on the internet.  The code is cobbled together from a bunch of other projects.

To compile code in Arduino software please install:

ESP32 library
Instructions can be found here:

When I was building the project I set the settings as follows

Board: Firebeetle-ESP32
Baudrate 115200

This project also required the use of a servo library.  I used this one:
