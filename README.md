This project is putting a toaster on the internet.  The code is cobbled together from a bunch of other projects.

To compile code in Arduino software please install:

ESP32 library
Instructions can be found here:
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-dual-core-arduino-ide/

When I was building the project I set the settings as follows

Board: Firebeetle-ESP32
Baudrate 115200

You made need to install a serial driver to get this to work with the esp32 board.  I had to on both my Mac and PC.

This project also required the use of a servo library.  I used this one:

I followed these instructions too:

I would recommend working with original file.  The ALT may or may not compile
